// BSCS Admission System (Java + Swing GUI)

This is a simple Java-based admission system that uses a graphical user interface built with Swing. It simulates a university admission process by collecting student information, checking eligibility, updating test scores, and generating a merit list based on calculated scores.

Features:
Student form entry with auto-assigned roll numbers
Eligibility check based on FSc marks (must be 550 or higher)
Update test scores for eligible students
Display list of eligible candidates
Generate a merit list showing top 10 students sorted by total score

Technologies Used:
Java
Swing (GUI)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Scoring Formula:
The total score is calculated using the following weightage:

Total Score = (Matric Marks _ 10 / 1100) + (FSc Marks _ 50 / 1100) + (Test Marks _ 30 / 50) + (Interview Marks _ 10 / 20)
